# Unsupervised Machine Learning

 Unsupervised machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where algorithms are trained on unlabeled data without any guidance or predefined output. Unlike supervised learning, where algorithms learn from labeled data, unsupervised learning algorithms aim to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data.

Clustering and dimensionality reduction are two primary tasks in unsupervised learning:

- Clustering: This involves grouping similar data points together based on certain features or characteristics. The goal is to identify inherent structures within the data without any prior knowledge of the groups. Common clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.

- Dimensionality Reduction: In this task, the aim is to reduce the number of features (or dimensions) in the data while preserving its essential information. This is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data or for speeding up subsequent learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are popular techniques for dimensionality reduction.


## Applications of unsupervised learning include:

- Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data.
- Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior or demographic information.
- Recommendation Systems: Finding similarities among users or items to make personalized recommendations.
- Genomic Data Analysis: Identifying patterns in genetic data without prior knowledge.
- Image and Text Clustering: Organizing images or text documents into meaningful groups without labeled categories.
